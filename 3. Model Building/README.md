Model building can be broken down into four steps:

1) A rough model was created to explore the building process. All of the models in this project were built using Keras and Tensorflow in Google Colaboratory.
2) Models were optimised using the Random Search algorithm from Keras Tuner to find the optimal values for each of the model parameters.
3) The regression models were trained and tested for each of the 10 input indicators.
4) A classification model was created based upon the best model architecture discovered from step 3 and its performance was evaluated.
