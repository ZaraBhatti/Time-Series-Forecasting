The 14-day input, 7-day output model gave the best performance as it gave the lowest RMSE score therefore the tuned parameters from this optimisation will be used for all of the BiLSTM models in the rest of the project. The parameters and their optimal settings are listed below:

| Parameter  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Input Sequence Length  | 14 days  |
| Output Sequence Length  | 7 days  |
