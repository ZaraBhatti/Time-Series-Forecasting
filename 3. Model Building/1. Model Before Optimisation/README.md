A straight forward, multi-step LSTM was created using Keras and Tensorflow libraries to get a rough idea of its building process. Due to none of the parameters of the model being tuned, the model has failed to learn adequately. 

The hyperparameters of the model need to be tuned and different input/output sequence lengths should be tested to find the best optimised model.
